### Data acquisition

A quick examination of the [Open Street Map](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) map feature documentation gives several possible options of acquiring data.
The most obvious one would be the key 'piblic transport' and all its values:

 * stop_position 
 * platform 
 * station 
 * stop_area. 

At this point we have a chance to realize that the most apparant one is not always the best one. Further exporation and comparison with other datasets shows that it contains only bus stops for just a few bus routes ![values public transportation](graphics/public_transport_key.png).
